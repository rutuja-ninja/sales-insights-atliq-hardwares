## **Problem Statement**

AtliQ Hardware, a prominent supplier of computer hardware and peripherals with multiple branches across India, is struggling with declining sales and ineffective performance tracking. The Sales Director faces challenges in understanding the current business state, as reports from regional managers are often sugar-coated and loaded with complex Excel sheets. This overwhelming influx of numbers makes it hard for management to consume data effectively, hindering decision-making.

## **Solution**

To tackle this issue, AtliQ's Sales Director decided to implement a Power BI dashboard, aiming to convert raw data into visually engaging insights. This would enable the team to make data-driven decisions quickly and effectively. A dedicated team of data professionals was hired to build and optimize this dashboard.

## **AIMS Grid**

To ensure the project's focus and alignment with business goals, the AIMS Grid was employed:

- **Purpose:** Uncover hidden insights for the sales team and automate data processes to reduce manual efforts in data gathering.
- **Stakeholders:** Sales Director, Marketing Team, Customer Service Team, Data & Analytics Team, IT.
- **Success Criteria:** Develop dashboards that provide timely and actionable sales insights, contributing to a 10% cost saving of total spend through better decision-making.
- **End Result:** An automated, dynamic dashboard delivering the latest sales insights to support data-driven decisions.

## **Steps Followed in the Project**

1. **Initial Data Analysis:** Conducted high-level analysis using SQL to gain a thorough understanding of the dataset.
2. **Data Integration:** Connected the SQL datasets directly to Power BI for seamless data integration.
3. **ETL and Data Cleaning:** Performed ETL processes and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
4. **Currency Conversion:** Standardized transaction currencies to maintain uniformity across financial data.
5. **Measure Creation:** Developed various DAX measures to drive key insights within the Power BI visuals.
6. **Stakeholder Feedback:** Incorporated feedback from stakeholders to refine and enhance the dashboard.

## **Outcome and Impact**

The AtliQ Sales Insights Dashboard has provided a clear view of the sales landscape, highlighting performance issues and areas of improvement. The dashboard's automated approach reduces manual data processing time, allowing the sales team to focus on strategy rather than data entry. With this tool, AtliQ is now poised to make faster, more informed decisions, ultimately driving business growth.
